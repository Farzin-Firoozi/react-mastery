# Controlled components

## What are controlled components?

A component that controls the input elements within
the forms on subsequent user input is called
Controlled Component, i.e, every state mutation will
have an associated handler function.
For example, to write all the names in uppercase
letters, we use handleChange as below:

```jsx
handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value:
    event.target.value.toUpperCase()})
}

// controlled
<input value={someState} type="text" onChange={handleChange} />

// not controlled
<input type="text" onChange={handleChange} />

```

## What are uncontrolled components?

The Uncontrolled Components are the ones that store
their own state internally, and you query the DOM
using a ref to find its current value when you need it.
This is a bit more like traditional HTML.
In the below UserProfile component, the `name` input is
accessed using ref.

```jsx
class UserProfile extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
    this.input = React.createRef();
  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert("A name was submitted: " + this.input.current.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          {"Name:"}
          <input type="text" ref={this.input} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

In most cases, it's recommended to use controlled
components to implement forms.In a controlled
component, form data is handled by a React
component. The alternative is uncontrolled
components, where form data is handled by the
DOM itself.
