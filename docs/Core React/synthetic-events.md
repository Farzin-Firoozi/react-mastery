# Synthetic events

## What are synthetic events in React?

**SyntheticEvent** is a cross-browser wrapper around
the browser's native event.
It's API is the same as the browser's native event, including
`stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`,
except the events work identically across all
browsers.
