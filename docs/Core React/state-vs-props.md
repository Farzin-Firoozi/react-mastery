# State vs Props

Both props and state are plain JavaScript **objects**.
While both of them hold information that influences the
output of render, they are different in their functionality
with respect to components.

Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.

## props

- read only
- explains what we observe

## state

- affects the output
- can be modified
