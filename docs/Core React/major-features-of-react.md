# Major features of React

The major features of React are:

- It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM
  considering that RealDOM manipulations are
  expensive.
- It supports server-side rendering.
- It follows Unidirectional data flow or data
  binding.
- It uses reusable/composable UI components
  to develop the view
